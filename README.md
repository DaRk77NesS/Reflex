## 🎮 The Experience

REFLEX is designed with a **Spatial "Bento" UI**. The environment reacts to your selection, shifting themes and physics engines dynamically.

| Mode | Theme | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **⚡ Reaction** | **Volt Yellow** | Measures raw neurological reaction time via a high-precision `performance.now()` timer. Features a glass-morphic tile that shifts instantly from Red to Green. |
| **🎯 Aim Trainer** | **Crimson Red** | A "Gridshot" style tactical shooter. Three targets are always active. Destroy one, and another spawns instantly. Features custom crosshairs and hit markers. |
| **⌨️ Typing** | **Matrix Green** | A hacker-terminal style typing test. No input box—you type directly into the code. The interface glows brighter as your WPM increases. |
| **🖱️ CPS Test** | **Cyber Blue** | Measures Clicks Per Second. The interface ripples and pulses with every click, creating a satisfying feedback loop for high-speed clicking. |
